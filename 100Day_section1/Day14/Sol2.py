# Approach 2: Mathematical Deduction

'''
Actually, as it turns out, the sequence of G(n)G(n) function results is known as Catalan number C_nC 
n

 . And one of the more convenient forms for calculation is defined as follows:

C0 = 0; Cn+1 = 2(2n+1)/(n+2) * Cn

We skip the proof here, which one can find following the above reference.
