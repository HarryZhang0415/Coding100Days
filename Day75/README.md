# Closest Binary Search Tree Value

Given a non-empty binary search tree and a target value, find the value in the BST that is closest to the target.

Note:

Given target value is a floating point.
You are guaranteed to have only one unique value in the BST that is closest to the target.
Example:

Input: root = [4,2,5,1,3], target = 3.714286

    4
   / \
  2   5
 / \
1   3

Output: 4


# Path Sum III

You are given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer value.

Find the number of paths that sum to a given value.

The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards (traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).

The tree has no more than 1,000 nodes and the values are in the range -1,000,000 to 1,000,000.

Example:

root = [10,5,-3,3,2,null,11,3,-2,null,1], sum = 8

      10
     /  \
    5   -3
   / \    \
  3   2   11
 / \   \
3  -2   1

Return 3. The paths that sum to 8 are:

1.  5 -> 3
2.  5 -> 2 -> 1
3. -3 -> 11
